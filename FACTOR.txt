Problem definition
==================

You can describe the problem with the following points:

- The current database system was developed in 1989, and lacks a lot of wanted functionalities.
- The developer, Claus, is the only one who can modify and support the system.
- Claus is retiring.

To analyze the problems defined above and develop a system definition we use the FACTOR Criterion.

The FACTOR Criterion
--------------------

F: (functionality) Keeping track of the props and performances, and help in running these. As well as support the
   administration.
A: (application domain) Det Kongelige Teaters (The Royal Danish Theater) props department.
C: (conditions) The system should be usable by multiple user at a time, wherever there are access to the internet.
T: (technology) The system will be developed on standard laptops, and should be usable on standard PC's and tablets
   and supported by every OS.
O: (object) Props, pictures and employees in the props department.
R: (responsibility) Searching and administrative tool.

System Definition
-----------------

A web-based database-system of Det Kongelige Teaters props department. The system should primarily
be a searching tool used to prepare and run performances and search for props in current and previous productions by the
assistant stage managers, and secondly be used for budget monitoring, search for supplier information as well as keeping
track of all performance information, by the chairman of the props department. The system should be usable for people with
greatly variable computer experience.


Requirements
------------

We have had meetings with different people and have some sort of idea of the requirements but only april 9th these will be formalised more specifically.

Acceptance criteria - A minimum of requirements that our system should meet.


Constraints
-----------

- Login, they handle that somehow...
- Should be able to talk with a media database that they have. We make sure they can talk to each other.


Solution domain
---------------

The props department.
Cumulus, their media database. Only a limited part of this will be interfacing with our application though.
Most likely some sort of mirror of their data.


Application domain
------------------

The whole theater.


Deliverables
------------

- PHP code
- MySQL database
- Instructions in the form of meetings of papers explaining the system.
- Probably also some support during the initial start up phase.
